2a. Create a list where each of the list elements is a dictionary 
representing one of the network devices in the lab. Do this for at 
least four of the lab devices. The dictionary should have keys
corresponding to the device_name, host (i.e. FQDN), username, 
and password. Use a fictional username/password to avoid checking 
the lab password into GitHub.
